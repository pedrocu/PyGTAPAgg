What Software is Needed?
========================

What Software Do I Need?
PyGTAPAgg was developed on Microsoft Windows operating system.  The software has not been tested on widely used alternatives such as Linux and Apple OS.  Until the software is extensively tested on these operating systems (with the accompanying GEMPACK HAR and Tab files), we recommend user employ Windows.  The alternatives systems are not supported. 
Essential software are:

* Python 3.7 or above; 

*	PyQt (free for open-source projects); and

*	NumPy

The full environment can be loaded using a Python package manager such as pip or conda by applying the requirements file, as outlined in the instillation section following.   
Access to the GTAP Data Base can be obtained by purchasing an appropriate license from the GTAP Center at Purdue University. 
The current application requires that the GTAP database be extracted from its encrypted form.  This is most easily done by accessing the FlexAgg database and programs.
Note that each software module comes with license requirements. For most open-source projects, licensing is not a major barrier.
