# PyGTAPAgg
GTAP Agg Program in PyQt

# !!! THIS IS A BETA PROGRAM !!!
This application is currently underdevelopement.
The interface has been tested in flexagg version 11.
Only the flexagg database source will work, due to the encryption of the GTAPAgg version of the database.

Currently, PyGTAPAgg only supports GTAP model version 6.

Only the trully curious should proceed at this time.
